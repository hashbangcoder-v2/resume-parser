# AI-Powered Candidate Filtering System

This project is an AI-powered system to efficiently filter job candidates from a large pool of applicants. It leverages a modern web stack to provide a seamless user experience for recruiters and hiring managers.

## Architecture

The system is built with a flexible architecture that can be deployed in various environments, from local development to a scalable cloud setup.

- **Frontend**: A modern React single-page application built with Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. It is designed to be deployed on static hosting platforms like Vercel or Azure Static Web Apps.
- **Backend**: A robust API built with Python and FastAPI. It handles business logic, data processing, and communication with the database and AI models.
- **Database**: Uses SQLite for local development, making it easy to get started. For production, it can be configured to use any database supported by SQLAlchemy.
- **Storage**: Supports both local file storage and Azure Blob Storage for resumes and other assets.
- **AI Model**: Integrates with a Vision Language Model (VLM) for intelligent resume analysis. The model can be run locally or accessed via an Azure ML Online Endpoint.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: Contains the React frontend application.
- `backend/`: Contains the FastAPI backend application.
- `config/`: Holds environment-specific configurations for the backend.
- `database/`: Contains the local SQLite database file.
- `logs/`: Stores log files generated by the backend.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Required for the frontend.
- **Python**: Required for the backend.
- **Poppler**: A system-level dependency for processing PDF files.
- **uv**: A modern Python package manager (highly recommended)

**Installing Poppler:**
- **On Debian/Ubuntu:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y poppler-utils
  ```
- **On Windows:**
  Follow the instructions in the [pdf2image documentation](https://pypi.org/project/pdf2image/) to install Poppler for Windows.

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment and install all dependencies:**
    ```bash
    uv venv
    uv sync
    ```

3.  **Set the `PROJECT_ROOT` environment variable:**
    This variable is required for the backend to locate configuration and database files.

4.  **Seed the database (optional):**
    If you want to start with some sample data for local dev/testing:
    ```bash
    uv run seed_db
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Create a `.env.local` file:**
    This file stores the environment variables for the frontend.
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000"
    ```

3.  **Install the required Node.js packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    From the `backend` directory, run:
    ```bash
    uv run wfc-serve
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

2.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    From the `frontend` directory, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Deployment

### Frontend

One way to deploy your Next.js app is to use Azure Static Webapp.

### Backend
